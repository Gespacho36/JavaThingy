<h1>Welcome to the github repo!</h1>

<p>In here there will be an html file which you will need to clone, and it will
be the thing you'll run to see what we've gone over. </p>

<h3>To clone it, I prefer to do it with the CLI (Command Line Interface.)</h3>

<p>First off, go to the "<> Code" tab
Then, you'll see a green "<> Code" button
Click it, and under Clone, you should see an option that says Github CLI.</p>

<p>Since it is your first time using github, click the learn more and it takes you
to the website where you can download the github CLI for Windows </p>

<p>After you download the github CLI, go back to the Github CLI from the green "<> Code" button</p>

<h3>Copy the thing that says "gh repo clone ..." and then open up the CMD on your computer</h3>

<p>In CMD, you'll want to navigate to the folder that you want to clone the repository, ideally where your visual studio code is.</p>

<p>Once you do that, all you need to do is paste the command, and if the download for github windows 
works correctly, you should have a clone of the whole repository on your local computer.</p>

<p>From there you can run the html page and have everything you need, good luck :)</p>
